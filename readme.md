This was my first poke at the postcss module ecosystem &mdash; exploring what modules are out there and what I might want to include in a personal collection (to avoid having to repeatedly install and configure multiple postcss modules). Months later, it evolved into what is now [kirei-css](http://github.com/codekirei/kirei-css) (which was initially this repository's name &mdash; apologies for any confusion).
